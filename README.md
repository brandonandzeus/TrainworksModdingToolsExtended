# TrainworksModdingToolsExtended
This library contains upgrades to [TrainworksModdingTools](https://github.com/KittenAqua/TrainworksModdingTools) since it has been abandoned. Credit to the contributors of Trainworks Modding Tools for the original code.

This codebase is a fork with improvements to the Existing Builder classes that is to be used in tandem with the original codebase.

## Changes
Unfortunately TMTE is not a 100% drop in replacement and makes a few API breaking changes. This is a complete redesign of the Builders present in the original.
